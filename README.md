# Titan-Library
The purpose of this project is to create a JavaScript application that illustrates about the following:
1. **DOM Manipulation**
3. **Retriving Data From A Public API**
2. **Communication With The Server**
4. **Event Listeners**

### DOM Manipulation

The app demonstrates various DOM manipulation techniques to render a dynamic webpage.

### Retriving Data From A Public API

Titan Library uses the Open Library API to query the search and get a response in JSON format.
The app filters the data using several Array methods and dynamically updates the DOM and displays the results the user requested.

### Communication With The Server

Titan Library uses data from db.JSON to render a dynamic content about the users wishlists.
The app communcates with db.json using various HTTP Verbs such as GET and PATCH encompassed in JavaScript methods like fetch() to Add, Update or Delete user wishlists

### Event Listeners

The app includes various event listeners including DOMContentLoaded, which is the backbone of the application's functionality. Other event listeners have enhanaced features such as saving a form and clicking buttons.
